A challenger tries to reach the pinnacle of achievement in their chosen path, whether that is defined by combat, magic, stealth, or some other ability. They do this by throwing themself against progressively greater challenges, reveling in those just on the edge of their ability to covercome. A challenger is a good character to have in an adventuring party, since they do not quail under duress and often allows other party mmbers to take the best treasure. Indeed, some challengers see magic items as crutches, and they seek to attain perfection without them.`,

The normal motivations for adventuring -wealth, power, fame, personal betterment, excitement- hold scant apeal for a crusader; they are happiest when they are directly serving their cause.
